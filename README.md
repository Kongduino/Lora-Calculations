# Lora-Calculations

This is a small Xojo app I wrote to replace an Excel file I have created, and updated, over the years, to help me with calculations, some related to LoRa, some not so much. Instead of googling again and again, I would create a new tab and add a formula.

## Now in a nice GUI application!

Using Xojo it was easy enough to convert these sheets into tabs of similarly looking formulas, with text fields to change values, and results being output where convenient.
